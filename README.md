# GrenadeCast

## Disclaimer
This module is in no way intended to be a direct rip-off of FastCast,but rather an adaptation of it for grenades and objects with similar trajectories.

## Overview

GrenadeCast is a response to an issue found with most open source grenade systems on Roblox: grenades that are either:

1. Inefficient
2. Ineffective (doesn't use proper physics)
3. All of the above

To solve that issue, the founder of Crossforce Studios (Aerodos12), decided to make a specialized adaptation of FastCast by Xan_TheDragon (now EtiTheSpirit) for grenades.


## How it works

GrenadeCast uses trajectory physics as well as elastic calculations to operate.

**NOTE:** More explaining will be done here soon.
